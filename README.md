### Credit

A big thanks goes to @Falke-Design, he invests a lot of time and takes good care of Leaflet-Geoman.

Thanks to @ryan-morris for the implementation of Typescript and support with Typescript questions.

As I never built a leaflet plugin before, I looked heavily into the code of leaflet.draw to find out how to do stuff. So don't be surprised to see some familiar code.

I also took a hard look at the great [L.GeometryUtil](https://github.com/makinacorpus/Leaflet.GeometryUtil) for some of my helper functions.

The Rotate Mode are only working because of the great calculation code of [L.Path.Transform](https://github.com/w8r/Leaflet.Path.Transform)
